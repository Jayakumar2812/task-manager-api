# task-manager-api
This is an Task Manager app to store the tasks.
<br>
I have added authentication (User ID & Password) for making it production ready.
<br>
I have employed MongoDB for the purposes of storing all the tasks.
<br>
I have stored the password by hashing it such that the user privacy is maintained.
<br>
Every user has their own logins such that they would'nt be able to see others tasks.
<br>
I have also added Email gestures while joining the app to make it more real world.
<br>
I have used Express js,Node js and MongoDB thus far to build this.
<br>
Front-end is yet to be build because I have taken up Internships and will get back to this in the future.
